# Spam Filtering

An experimental spam detection project using Support Vector Machine (SVM) implemented in R.

## Overview

This project implements a spam classifier to distinguish spam and non-spam (ham) messages using the SVM algorithm.  
It is written in R and designed for experimentation with text classification techniques.

## Features

- Spam vs. ham classification using SVM  
- Dataset included for training and testing  
- Simple, straightforward R implementation without external dependencies

## Installation

Make sure you have R installed on your system. Then clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grzesiekmq/spam-filtering.git
```
## Usage

Open the spam.r script in an R environment (RStudio or command line) and run it to train and test the spam classifier.
The dataset files data.csv and names.csv are used as input data.
